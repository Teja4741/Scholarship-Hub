// This file is kept for fallback purposes. The app now uses API calls to fetch scholarships.
// Uncomment the code below if you need to use static data instead of the API.

// import { Scholarship } from '@/types/scholarship';

// export const scholarships: Scholarship[] = [
//   // ... scholarship data
// ];

// Export empty array as fallback
export const scholarships: any[] = [];
